//! Bounded-read child-process IO for `invoke.rs`.
//!
//! Wave 44d resource-cap hardening: the previous `wait_with_output()`
//! buffered ALL stdout/stderr before any size check ran — a malicious
//! atom writing 10 GiB of zeros would OOM the runtime before truncation.
//! This module replaces that with size-tracked stream readers that KILL
//! the child the moment a cap is exceeded — the kill is issued from
//! INSIDE the reader thread so an unbounded writer cannot deadlock the
//! parent (post-hoc kill would never happen because the reader would
//! never return on infinite stdout).
//!
//! Constructor Pattern: extracted as a sibling module so `invoke.rs`
//! stays under 200 LOC and per-function under 30 LOC.
